# From the Deep

In this problem, you'll write freeform responses to the questions provided in the specification.

## Random Partitioning

why we should adopt this technique,my thoughts are as the data will be evenly distrubuted it would be great for handling large traffic and it would be highly availabe.

why we not should adopt this is, because we may have to write complex quires on all shards,it would be hard to manage all of them.we cannot optimize them according to certain condition(like location,popularity)

## Partitioning by Hour

the data might not be evenly distributed,the data rate would be variable,if data rate is almost same then it would be best method to do it as if we need particular data we can locate it easily

## Partitioning by Hash Value

data will be evenly distrubuted and efficient ,hasing algorithm map same input to same parition.why not?,we have to run hashing algorithm on top storing,very complex to manage
